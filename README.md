# tic-tac-toe-console

One of my first larger projects, made to be played by two people. 

Main funtionality is to allow two people to play one or more games of tic-tac through the command line interface or terminal. 
Secondary functionality includes, tracking of names, checking for user input errors, allowing multiple games without exiting the program, and diplaying the board and print text in a formatted and centered style.
